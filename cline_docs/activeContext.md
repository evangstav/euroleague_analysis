# Active Context

## Current State
The project is a Euroleague basketball analysis system with several key components:

1. Data Collection System
   - Implemented in `euroleague_data_collector.py`
   - Gathers game and player statistics

2. Feature Engineering Pipeline
   - Complex SQL-based feature extraction
   - Multiple statistical views for different aspects:
     - Shot patterns
     - Play-by-play features
     - Position matchup analysis
     - Rolling statistics

3. Model Training and Prediction
   - PIR (Performance Index Rating) prediction system
   - Configurable model parameters
   - DVC-managed training pipeline

## Recent Changes
Based on the repository structure and file timestamps:
- Latest report generated on January 6, 2025
- Model update script (`update_model.sh`) present
- Feature outputs tracked in `feature_outputs.json`

## Next Steps
1. Code Analysis
   - Review SQL queries for optimization opportunities
   - Analyze feature engineering pipeline efficiency
   - Evaluate model performance metrics

2. Documentation
   - Document SQL query patterns
   - Update feature engineering documentation
   - Review and update model configuration parameters

3. Technical Improvements
   - Optimize data collection process
   - Enhance feature engineering pipeline
   - Review and update model training process
